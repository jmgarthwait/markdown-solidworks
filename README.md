# How to Model a Cylinder in SolidWorks

SolidWorks is a computer-aided design (CAD) software that allows the user to design models of parts. It allows the user to visualize and analyze an object without the need to construct it in reality. A cylinder is an easy to construct object that will introduce you to SolidWorks' basic workflow.
### Caution: Using a computer continuously for long periods of time may lead to eye, back, and hand injuries. Be sure to take breaks as needed.

## Requirements:

- A computer capable of running SolidWorks
- An internet connection
- A SolidWorks license (may be offered through your institution)
- A mouse with scroll wheel (recommended)

## Steps

1. Download and open SolidWorks.
2. Click "Part" under "New" on the welcome screen to create a new part.
3. Under the "Sketch" tab, click on the "Sketch" button to begin a new sketch. The easiest way to create an object in SolidWorks is to create a 2D sketch, then extrude into 3D.
4. Click on the plane you wish to create your sketch in to initialize the sketch.
5. Click on the "Circle" tool.
6. Click on your screen to place the center point of the circle. Then, drag your mouse to the desired radius, and click to complete the circle.
7. Click the "Exit Sketch" button to complete your sketch.
8. Under the "Features" tab, click on the "Extruded Boss/Base" button. This tool allows you to extrude your sketch into 3D. Since there is only one sketch, this tool will automatically select that sketch to extrude.
9. Enter the height you wish to extrude your sketch. The program will display a preview of the extrusion so you can better visualize.
10. Click the green checkmark to complete the extrusion. The cylinder is now finished.
11. Click the save button to save your cylinder for future use.
